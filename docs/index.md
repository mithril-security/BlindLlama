## üìú What is BlindLlama?
________________________________________________________

### Introduction

üõ†Ô∏è **BlindLlama** makes it easy to use open-source LLMs by using **Zero-trust AI APIs** that abstract all the complexity of model deployment while ensuring **users‚Äô data is never exposed** to us thanks to end-to-end protection with **secure hardware**.

üîê To provide guarantees to developers that data sent to our managed infrastructure is not exposed, we have developed a **Zero-trust architecture to serve AI models**.

> We currently serve [Llama2](https://ai.meta.com/llama/) but will be making more open-source models available in the near future!

Our backend has two key properties:

+ **Confidentiality**: Your data is **never accessible to us**. We serve AI models inside **hardened environments** that do not expose data even to our admins. All points of access, such as SSH, logs, networks, etc., are blocked to ensure the isolation of data.

+ **Transparency**: We provide you with verifiable **cryptographic proof** that these controls are in place, thanks to the use of [Trusted Platform Modules (TPMs)](./docs/getting-started/concepts.md/#trusted-platform-modules-tpms).


!!! warning
  
	BlindLlama is still **under development**. Do not use it in production!

	We are working towards the first audit of BlindLlama in the following months. Please refer to the [roadmap](#vision-roadmap) to know the current status of the project.

We welcome contributions to our project from the community! Don't hesitate to [raise issues](https://github.com/mithril-security/blind_llama/issues) on GitHub, [reach out to us](#getting-help) or see our guide on how to audit BlindLlama (**coming soon!**).


## üë©üèª‚Äçüíª Use cases

BlindLlama is meant to **help developers working with sensitive data to easily get started with LLMs** by using **managed AI APIs** that abstract the hardware and software complexity of model deployment while ensuring their data remains unexposed.

Several scenarios can be answered by using BlindLlama, such as:

+ Benchmarking the best open-source LLMs against one‚Äôs private data to find out which one is the most relevant without having to do any provisioning
+ Structuring medical documents
+ Analysis or auto-completion of a confidential code base

### ‚úÖ When should you use BlindLlama?

+ You want to get started with LLMs that are complex to deploy, such as Llama 2 70B
+ You don‚Äôt want to manage that infrastructure as it requires too much time, expertise and/or budget
+ You don‚Äôt want to expose your data to a third party AI provider that manages the infrastructure for you due to privacy/compliance issues

#### ‚ùå What is not covered by BlindLlama?

+ BlindLlama is simply a drop-in replacement to query a remotely hosted model instead of having to go through complex local deployment. We do not cover training from scratch, but we will cover fine-tuning soon.
+ BlindLlama allows you to quickly and securely leverage models which are open-source, such as Llama 2, StarCoder, etc. **Proprietary models from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere are not supported** yet as we would require them to modify their backend to offer a Zero-trust AI infrastructure like ours.
+ **BlindLlama‚Äôs trust model implies some level of trust in Cloud providers and hardware providers** since we leverage secure hardware available and managed by Cloud providers (see our [trust model section](./docs/getting-started/blindllama-101.md/#trust-model) for more details).

BlindLlama virtually provides the same level of security, privacy, and control as solutions provided by Cloud providers like Azure OpenAI Services.

## üöÄ Getting started
________________________________________________________

- Check out our [Quick tour](./docs/getting-started/quick-tour.ipynb), which will enable you to play with an example using the [Llama 2](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-2-7b) model while ensuring your data remains private and without the hassle of provisioning!
- Find out more about [How we protect your data](./docs/getting-started/how-we-achieve-zero-trust.md)
- Discover the [architecture](./docs/blind_llama/architecture.md) and [trust model](./docs/blind_llama/trust-model.md) behind BlindLlama.
 
<!--
## üìö How is the documentation structured?
____________________________________________
<!--
- [Tutorials](./docs/tutorials/core/installation.md) take you by the hand to install and run BlindBox. We recommend you start with the **[Quick tour](./docs/getting-started/quick-tour.ipynb)** and then move on to the other tutorials!  

- [Concepts](./docs/concepts/nitro-enclaves.md) guides discuss key topics and concepts at a high level. They provide useful background information and explanations, especially on cybersecurity.

- [How-to guides](./docs/how-to-guides/deploy-API-server.md) are recipes. They guide you through the steps involved in addressing key problems and use cases. They are more advanced than tutorials and assume some knowledge of how BlindBox works.

- [API Reference](https://blindai.mithrilsecurity.io/en/latest/blindai/client.html) contains technical references for BlindAI‚Äôs API machinery. They describe how it works and how to use it but assume you have a good understanding of key concepts.

- [Security](./docs/security/remote_attestation/) guides contain technical information for security engineers. They explain the threat models and other cybersecurity topics required to audit BlindBox's security standards.

- [Advanced](./docs/how-to-guides/build-from-sources/client/) guides are destined to developers wanting to dive deep into BlindBox and eventually collaborate with us to the open-source code.

- [Past Projects](./docs/past-projects/blindai) informs you of our past audited project BlindAI, of which BlindBox is the evolution.

<!-- ## ‚ùì Why trust us?
___________________________

+ **Our core security features are open source.** We believe that transparency is the best way to ensure security and you can inspect the code yourself on our [GitHub page](https://github.com/mithril-security/blindbox).

+ **Our historical project [BlindAI](docs/past-projects/blindai.md) was successfully audited** by Quarkslab. Although both projects differ (BlindAI was meant for the confidential deployment of ONNX models inside Intel SGX enclaves), we want to highlight that we are serious about our security standards and know how to code secure remote attestation. -->

## üéØ Roadmap
___________________________

There are three key milestones planned for the BlindLlama project.

### BlindLlama Alpha (non-secure) launch: 

A demo BlindLlama API launched serving Llama2-70b without full security features

**Features:**

- Client-side Python SDK
- Mithril Cloud hosting of BlindLlama API & API key provisioning website
- Basic server-side implementation without full security features:
    - Attestation with TPMs partially implemented but awaiting Cloud provider endorsement certificate for finalization
    - Client-side verifications partially implemented but awaiting Cloud provider endorsement certificate for finalization
- Whitepaper & documentation detailing the project‚Äôs full technical details (of implemented & planned features)

> Expected deadline: week ending 08/09/2023

### BlindLlama Beta launch:

An MVP with end-to-end protection but not yet fully hardened or audited.

This version builds on BlindLlama Alpha launch with the following **new features:**

- TPM-based attestation fully implemented
    - Attested TLS
- Client verification fully implemented
- Server-side environment partially hardened but will not yet include full security features

> Expected deadline: week ending 06/10/2023

### BlindLlama 1.0 hardened and audit-ready launch:

A fully-secure version of BlindLlama ready for audit.

This version builds on BlindLlama Beta launch with the following **new features:**

- Fully hardened server-side environment
    - Hardened AI container
    - Hardened OS
- Verifiable provenance of binary (making a collection of verifiable data about BlindLlama builds available)

> Expected deadline: week ending 08/12/2023

You can check out our progress to achieveing these milestones on our [official roadmap](https://www.notion.so/mithril-security/BlindLlama-roadmap-d55883a04be446e49e01ee884c203c26).

## üîí Who made BlindLlama?
________________________________________________________

BlindLlama is developed by **Mithril Security**, a startup focused on **democratizing privacy-friendly AI using secure hardware solutions**. 

We have already had our first project, [BlindAI](https://github.com/mithril-security/blindai), an open-source Rust inference server that deploys ONNX models on Intel SGX secure enclaves, audited by [Quarkslab](https://www.quarkslab.com/).

BlindLlama builds on the foundations of BlindAI but provides much faster performance and focuses on serving managed models directly to developers instead of helping AI engineers to deploy models.
