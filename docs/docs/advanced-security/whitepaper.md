# Introducing the BlindLlama whitepaper
________________________________________________________

We have launched the BlindLlama whitepaper to cover the architecture and security features behind BlindLLama in depth.

The whitepaper is intended for an expert audience with security expertise, contrary to the other sections within our documentation that are aimed at a broader technical public.

You can read or download the whitepaper [here](https://docsend.com/view/dkepc5fd8njh7i46)!

> Note that we will continue to update this whitepaper as and when required.
