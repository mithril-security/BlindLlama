# Attested TLS
________________________________________________________

Transport Layer Security, or TLS, refers to a secure protocol used for host-to-host, such as client to server, communications.

TLS keeps all data sent between two hosts safe by encrypting the data using a unique session key known to the two parties. The data remains encrypted in transit before being decrypted by the receiving party.

With BlindLlama, end users can verify that TLS is implemented for our APIs as part of TPM-based attestation.
