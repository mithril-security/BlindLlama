In this `concepts` section, we will describe the key concepts that are at the core of BlindLlama:

+ [**Hardened environments**](./hardened-environments.md): We describe how we harden our AI inference server to remove data exposure even to our admins
+ [**Trusted Computing Base (TCB)**](./TCB.md): We detail the trusted and verified components in our APIs
+ [**Trusted Platform Modules (TPMs)**](./TPMs.md): We explain how we use TPMs to provide cryptographic proof to outsiders that those controls are in place
+ [**Attested TLS**](./TPMs.md): We describe how we secure communications with our APIs
